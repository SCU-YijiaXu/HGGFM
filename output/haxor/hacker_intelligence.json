The temporal distribution of records, showing bursts of activity on the same day against different domains, reinforces an unsophisticated broad-scan methodology. The technological breadth of targets further implies limited technical preference, focusing instead on resourced low- to mid-tier sites. These behaviors collectively indicate a likely non-advanced, efficiency-driven actor, with potential affiliation or similarity to groups using volume-based opportunistic intrusion strategies.", "analysis_process": "Analysis first segmented records by activity time to detect clustering; many attacks cluster within short periods, denoting campaign-style operations. Mapping IPs to domains revealed repeated use, hinting at shared hosting targets and indiscriminate attacks. Examination of 'Residual Clues' showed scarce direct indicators but inferred automation through attack frequency and breadth. Technical analysis showed attack independence from specific web technologies, underscoring lack of unique technical preference.

{"hacker_id": "1920", "hacker_name": "CxT7", "attribute_name": "Behavior analysis", "attribute_content": "The hacker demonstrates targeted behavior by attacking orhempfarms.com on 2021-06-19, specifically accessing the /de.txt page using the IP 148.66.133.91. The consistent use of Apache as both the operating system and web server suggests familiarity or preference for certain server environments, possibly leveraging known vulnerabilities. The attack vector, focusing on a .txt file, may indicate reconnaissance tactics or attempts at file retrieval/manipulation. The chosen time suggests planned exploitation as opposed to opportunistic scanning. These behavioral patterns, including the technical stack preference and precise target selection, highlight potential grouping characteristics with threat actors specializing in web application attacks on Apache-based infrastructures.", "analysis_process": "1. Time: The attack occurred at a specific date, indicating premeditation. 2. IP and Domain: The attacker operates via a single IP with a matching domain, suggesting organized targeting rather than broad-based scans. 3. Residual Clues: The accessed /de.txt page could imply interest in localized resources or configuration files. 4. Technical Preference and Attack Processes: Repeated engagement with Apache systems hints at a technical focus and likely use of known Apache vulnerabilities. 5. Target Continuity and Tactical Path: The observed actions form a coherent tactical path, from target selection to methodical page access, mirroring behaviors seen in coordinated attack groups. These factors collectively reveal behavioral patterns consistent with group-based, infrastructure-specific web attacks."}
{"hacker_id": "1921", "hacker_name": "HaxorID Team", "attribute_name": "Behavior analysis", "attribute_content": "The observed behavior patterns of the hacker node indicate a methodical and potentially organized operational profile. The use of a localhost IP address (127.0.0.1) in conjunction with the domain hax.or.id on the primary page (/) points toward either a proxy setup or a testing phase common in coordinated attack preparations. The Nginx server is both the operating system and web server, suggesting technical familiarity with mainstream web infrastructure, likely exploited for penetration testing or staging attacks. These actions display a tendency for operational compartmentalization and technical efficiency, which are characteristics often present in group-based hacker entities. Analysis of the timing, infrastructure selection, and lack of visible payload residue further support the likelihood of deliberate, covert behavior typical of experienced or collective actors.", "analysis_process": "The 'Time' dimension establishes the event chronology, tying activity to the 2019-11-25 window. 'IP and Domain' analysis suggests obfuscation or internal testing, with localhost and a dedicated hacker-themed domain. 'Residual Clues' are minimal, indicating anti-forensic tactics. 'Technical preference and Attack Process' show strong Nginx affinity, revealing attack vector specialization. 'Target Continuity and Tactical Path' infer an iterative or preparatory approach, with attack pathways designed for anonymity and reuse, aligning with behaviors seen in organized hacker collectives."}
